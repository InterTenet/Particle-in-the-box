Particle in the box (Unidimensinal box)
The problem of a microscopic particle running along a single dimension, constrained to a region of length L by two infinite potential barriers is called a particle in a one-dimensional box. To find the possible wave functions for the steady states of this system and the corresponding possible energy values, it is necessary to solve the eigenvalue equation:

 ℋ𝜓  = 𝐸𝜓
 
 subject to boundary conditions:
 
 ℋ = −(ℏ/2𝑚)𝜕²/𝜕𝑥²

Each pair (eigenvector, eigenvalue) solution to the problem denotes a distinct steady state and the energy value of that state.
It was written a python scrip, along with some of its packages (Sympy, Numpy and Pandas), in order to retreive, by means of the eigenvalue equation, the wave and density functions of the first 4 energy levels.
